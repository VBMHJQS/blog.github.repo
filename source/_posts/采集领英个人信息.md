**程序写的比较粗糙，主要就是处理领英页面信息的逻辑，提供一种思路，用得到的可以自行优化**

<!--more-->

> LinkedIn是全球最大的职业社交网站，是一家面向商业客户的社交网络（SNS）

最近写了一个采集个人信息的程序，用的java语言，springboot框架，因为领英做了一些防爬虫处理，所以返回来的数据需要做些处理，主要逻辑代码如下
```java
package linkedin.service;

import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.FailingHttpStatusCodeException;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebClient;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebRequest;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebResponse;

import linkedin.model.LinkedInModel;
import net.sf.json.JSONArray;
import net.sf.json.JSONObject;
